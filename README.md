Wordle but it's on your Terminal!

## What's Wordle? 🤔
Wordle is a classic word guessing game developed by Josh Wardle. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word; feedback is given for each guess, in the form of colored tiles, indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.

You can play the original Wordle Game [here](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).
